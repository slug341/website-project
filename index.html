<br>
9/2 Update: Gojira to open the show on the 14th and Baroness to open the show on the 16th.<br>
<br>
We're excited to be heading back to Canada this Fall for what promises to be a very unique historical pair of shows as we have been invited to usher out the legendary Colisee Pepsi and welcome the brand new Centre Videotron all in a three day period! On September 14th, we'll be taking the stage for the final event held at the long time mainstay Colisee Pepsi, the classic hockey arena that made its debut in 1949. Our first appearance there was in 1989 and since then we've played seven shows in the arena, including the two shows filmed for the Quebec Magnetic DVD release. Two days later on September 16th we'll open the doors to the brand new Centre Videotron for the first event to ever be held there. How cool is that?!<br>
<br>
Always one of our favorite places to visit, Quebec City also has a long history of being the home to some of the most rabid 'Tallica fans anywhere. It only seems fitting that we share this special passing of the torch with you! Each show will be a completely different experience right down to where we set up the stage. Look for one night with the classic end stage, the other in the round, different set lists and even different opening bands . . . two totally different Met experiences in one 48 hour period!</p>
                <h2>Megadeth News</h2>
                <p>Lamb of God / Megadeth drummer Chris Adler was a recent guest on the Eddie Trunk Podcast, and the mega-talented stickman spoke about a bunch of topics. In the interview, Adler hints at a North American Megadeth / Lamb of God tour where he'll pull double duty, gives his honest opinion of Megadeth's recent albums. and offers his take on why metalheads tend to take shots at Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine.<br>
                <br>
Though the last couple of Megadeth records were admittedly not Adler's favorite, he spoke about the respect he had for Megadeth in following their creative direction at the time. "They were not my favorite Megadeth records, but I think it's great that that band has been able to do those things - whatever they wanted to do - and not try to please everybody, and it's not gonna be the same every single time," Adler said before detailing his experience working with Megadeth on Dystopia. "It was super intimidating for me to come in and do that, because [Dave Mustaine is] my hero. Now, the big thing was none of the material was stinker stuff. I mean, the guy is writing amazing stuff just all day long; in his sleep he's writing better riffs than... well, the whole world."<br>
<br>
Megadeth and Lamb of God will rock the U.K. together in November, but the bill may not stop there. "There is talk of having us do a North American run together early next year, so I'd be doing it every night," Adler revealed. "I''m carb-loading before the show. I have been working really, really hard over the past probably 10 years to keep myself in shape. What I try to do is about a 10-mile run every day, and then I play the Lamb of God show. So I figure those two things together are probably gonna equal what I do with these guys."
As for reports that Dave Mustaine is difficult to work with, Adler states: "I think people like to pick on Dave, because it's easy to pick on the king. This is the guy, for me, that created this whole thing, so it's always easy to pick on the guy at the top." [via Blabbermouth]</p>
                <h2>Slayer News</h2>
                <p>Slayer unleashed their new album Repentless in September, their first disc following the death of guitarist Jeff Hanneman in 2013. While on this year's Motorhead's Motorboat, we caught up with Slayer drummer Paul Bostaph, who discussed Slayer's new release and spoke very fondly about Hanneman. He also made it clear that he's not going anywhere and he intends to continue with Slayer for the long haul.<br>
                <br>
Repentless - what does the title mean to you personally?<br>
<br>
It means to live your life the way you want to live it and feel good about the way you do it. Actually, it reminds me of being free, that's what it means to me and not having to ask forgiveness of anybody.<br>
<br>
It''s your first album with Slayer since 2001's God Hates Us All. How was the overall creative and recording process for you on this album?
I was very focused for a number of reasons, obviously being away from Slayer and the situation under which I came back to the band a lot of changes happened at once. It was a tremendous amount of pressure and I knew that, I knew along with that pressure that this was a very important record for us. It was something where I felt like some bands would just pack it in and give up and I felt that Jeff [Hanneman] wouldn't want us to do that. I felt like we had to do this, for me it was no question this record had to happen at any sacrifice I had to make.<br>
<br>
Did the passing of Jeff Hanneman put even more pressure on you and the band when recording Repentless?<br>
<br>
I think it was more pressure for the band, not for me, but for all of us. Knowing that pressure did exist made me bear down harder.<br>
<br>
Can you talk about your relationship with Jeff and some things you will remember most about him?<br>
<br>
I love Jeff. He was a guy who always wanted to laugh whether he was bored or if something wasn''t happening - some people look for moments of solitude and the road offers you too much of that and Jeff just always wanted to laugh. I think my biggest memory of him was the fact that when we were traveling I think he had an appreciation for certain things that I didn't have an appreciation for, like knowing you were in a city where a historical event happened, some people don't think about that. We did a ferry crossing a long time ago and we were actually making the same crossing that the allies made in World War II. I remember being on the back of the boat, it was Jeff and I, and we both appreciated that moment.<br>
<br>
This is your third stint with Slayer. Do you see yourself playing with Slayer for the long haul this time around?<br>
<br>
Yes. When I was asked to come back - I left the band twice, let's get real, you know and when you get asked to come back to a band, I'm not going to come back only to leave a third time. I'm here for the long haul.</p>
